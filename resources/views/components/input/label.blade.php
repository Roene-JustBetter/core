It's called a label but it isn't? ðŸ¤¯ Yup, as it's just for styling ðŸŽ¨
The benefit of this approach is that you don't have to deal with
"for" attributes on labels and matching input names. Usage:
```
<label>
    <x-rapidez::input.label>@lang('Firstname')</x-rapidez::input.label>
    <x-rapidez::input name="firstname"/>
</label>
```
By default a label has an asterix when the input is required. If you don't want an asterix
you can use the label like this:
```
<x-label class="after:hidden" />
```
--}}
<span {{ $attributes->twMerge("font-medium text-inactive text-sm inline-block mb-2 has-[~_*_:required,~:required]:after:content-['*']") }}>
    {{ $slot }}
</span>
